### ‚ú® Project Features

*   **Interactive Prediction:** An easy-to-use tabbed interface with sliders for inputting student data across 12 key features (Academic, Health, and Behavioral).
*   **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes a highly accurate **XGBoost Classifier** (97% accuracy) trained on simulated data to predict burnout risk across three levels: **Low**, **Medium**, and **High**.
*   **Personalized Feedback:** Provides simple, rule-based reasoning and actionable advice based on the user's specific inputs to help them identify and address potential risk factors.
*   **Data-Driven Explainability:** The underlying Jupyter Notebook includes **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to understand the key drivers behind the model's predictions.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

There are two main components to this project: the analysis notebook and the interactive web app.

1.  **To explore the full machine learning workflow:**
    Open and run the `Burnout_Project.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

2.  **To launch the interactive web application:**
    Make sure you are in the project's root directory in your terminal and that the virtual environment is active. Then run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your web browser will automatically open with the application running.

### üß† Machine Learning Workflow

The model was developed following a structured machine learning pipeline:

1.  **Data Simulation:** A dataset of 6,000 students was programmatically generated with 12 relevant features (e.g., GPA, Sleep Hours, Missed Deadlines).
2.  **Feature Engineering:** A `BurnoutRisk` target variable (Low, Medium, High) was created based on a scoring system derived from the input features.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The data distribution and feature correlations were analyzed to gain insights before modeling.
4.  **Preprocessing:** The categorical target variable was label-encoded, and numerical features were standardized using `StandardScaler`.
5.  **Model Selection:** Four different models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost) were trained and evaluated. **XGBoost** was selected as the final model due to its superior performance.
6.  **Model Evaluation:** The final XGBoost model was fine-tuned and achieved **~97% accuracy** on the unseen test set, validated with 5-fold cross-validation.
7.  **Explainability (XAI):** SHAP values were calculated in the notebook to identify which features were the most influential drivers of the model's predictions, ensuring the model's logic is transparent.

### üöÄ Future Improvements

*   **Integrate Real-World Data:** Replace the simulated dataset with anonymous data from a university survey for a more accurate and impactful model.
*   **Dynamic SHAP Explanations:** Integrate SHAP force plots directly into the Streamlit app to provide users with data-driven, visual feedback on their specific inputs.
*   **User Accounts:** Implement a simple user login to allow students to track their burnout risk over time.
